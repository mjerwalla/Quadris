# CS 246 Quadris Project
This is our sick final project for CS 246 at uWaterloo, in the Fall 2017 term.
We will be making our own version of Quadris, a Tetris rip-off defined for this project by the CS 246 staff [(see assignment description)](documentation/quadris.pdf).
Further details about the course can be found [here](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs246/).

Step one of our project was to come up with a plan: check that out [here](documentation/quadrisplan.pdf).

Project finished and **completely functional** (WOOOO!!) as of December 5, 2016. A makefile can be found in /code and further details about our implementation can be found [here](documentation/FinalDesignDocument.pdf).
